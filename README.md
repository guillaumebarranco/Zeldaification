# Zeldaification
Development of a Chrome Extension copying the behaviour of the nCage extension.

This extension just replace every picture on your browser by a Zelda relative picture found on the web.

Just an experiment though.

## Installation
Just clone the repository, then go on your Chrome extensions and enable the developer mode.
Choose "load the extension" and then take the entire folder.
Now you can just browse and have fun for around two minutes before disabling it.
